# vf2lib
The library, writte in ANSI-C, contatins the implementation  of the well-known algorithms to solve graph and subgraph isomorphism: VF, VF2 and Ullmann.

The library contains solvers for: 
* Graph Isomorphism
* Subgraph Isomorphism
* Subgraph Monomorphism (VF2 Only)
* Maximum Common Subgraph (VF3 Only)
